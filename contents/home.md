Hello I'm Maximus Perez, a passionate student exploring the world of technology and design. I'm currently focused on building a strong foundation in programming, game design, and user experience.
    
I'm a programmer with a drive for game design.  I enjoy using creativity with logic and code to try to make fun experiences for people to enjoy.
    
My long-term goal is to work in interactive software or game development or just programming in general, creating meaningful, immersive systems that are both fun and functional. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy challenges that push my creative boundaries.
